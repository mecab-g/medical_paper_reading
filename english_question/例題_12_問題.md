[1] Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have revolutionized the treatment landscape for various malignancies. However, the identification of reliable biomarkers to predict treatment response remains a significant challenge. This study investigated the potential of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and immune cell profiling as predictive biomarkers for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

[2] In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 156 patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC who received first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 6-week intervals during treatment. We performed next-generation sequencing of ctDNA and comprehensive immune cell profiling using flow cytometry. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR).

[3] Our analysis revealed that patients with high baseline ctDNA levels (>100 copies/mL) had significantly shorter PFS compared to those with low levels (median PFS: 3.2 vs 8.7 months; hazard ratio [HR]: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.9-4.1; p<0.001). Furthermore, the presence of specific immune cell subsets, particularly CD8+ T cells with high PD-1 expression and low TIM-3 expression, was associated with improved treatment response. Patients with this favorable immune profile showed an ORR of 45% compared to 15% in those without (p<0.001).

[4] Longitudinal monitoring of ctDNA levels demonstrated that early clearance of ctDNA (within 6 weeks of treatment initiation) was strongly predictive of long-term outcomes. Patients who achieved ctDNA clearance had a 2-year OS rate of 65% compared to 25% in those who did not (HR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6; p<0.001). This finding suggests that ctDNA dynamics may serve as an early indicator of treatment efficacy.

[5] The integration of ctDNA and immune profiling data improved the predictive accuracy of treatment response. A composite biomarker score incorporating both ctDNA levels and immune cell characteristics achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85 for predicting 1-year PFS, significantly outperforming individual biomarkers (p<0.001).

[6] These findings highlight the potential of combining liquid biopsy and immune profiling as a comprehensive approach to predict and monitor response to immunotherapy. The early identification of non-responders could facilitate timely treatment modifications and improve patient outcomes. Further validation in larger cohorts and different cancer types is warranted to establish the generalizability of these biomarkers.
