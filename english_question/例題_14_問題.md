## Original Text / 英文

[1] Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current treatments primarily focus on symptom management, but there is an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation in patients with moderate to severe PD, with a focus on long-term outcomes and potential disease modification.

[2] In this phase II clinical trial, we enrolled 45 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 2.5-4) who were randomized to receive either NSC transplantation (n=30) or sham surgery (n=15). The NSCs were derived from human embryonic stem cells and differentiated into dopaminergic neurons. Each patient received bilateral transplantation of 2 million cells per side into the putamen. The primary endpoint was the change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score at 24 months, with secondary endpoints including quality of life measures and imaging biomarkers.

[3] At 24 months, the NSC transplantation group showed a significant improvement in motor symptoms compared to the sham group (mean change in UPDRS motor score: -15.2 vs -2.1 points; p<0.001). The improvement was particularly notable in patients with Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 (mean change: -18.5 points). Quality of life measures, assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), showed a 35% improvement in the transplantation group compared to 8% in the sham group (p<0.001).

[4] Longitudinal follow-up using [18F]DOPA PET imaging revealed increased dopaminergic activity in the transplanted regions. The mean increase in striatal [18F]DOPA uptake was 42% in the NSC group at 24 months, compared to a 5% decrease in the sham group (p<0.001). This finding suggests that the transplanted cells were functionally integrated into the host brain tissue.

[5] Safety analysis showed that the procedure was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to the transplantation. The most common adverse events were transient headaches (23% of patients) and mild dyskinesia (17% of patients), which resolved within 3 months. No evidence of tumor formation or immune rejection was observed during the 24-month follow-up period.

[6] These results demonstrate that NSC transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for PD, with significant improvements in motor symptoms and quality of life. The long-term follow-up data suggest that the treatment may have disease-modifying effects, as evidenced by the sustained improvement in motor symptoms and increased dopaminergic activity. Further studies with larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the durability of the treatment effect.
