## Original Text / 英文

[1] Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most challenging malignancies to diagnose and treat, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Early detection is crucial for improving outcomes, but current screening methods lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This study evaluated the efficacy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based imaging analysis system for the early detection of pancreatic cancer using computed tomography (CT) scans.

[2] We developed a deep learning algorithm trained on a dataset of 2,500 CT scans from patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer and 7,500 scans from healthy controls. The algorithm was designed to detect subtle changes in pancreatic tissue texture and vascular patterns that are often missed by conventional radiological assessment. The study included 1,200 patients who underwent routine abdominal CT scans at our institution between 2018 and 2022.

[3] The AI system demonstrated remarkable performance in detecting early-stage pancreatic cancer. In the validation cohort of 300 patients, the system achieved a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 89% for detecting pancreatic cancer at stages I and II. The positive predictive value was 78%, and the negative predictive value was 97%. These results significantly outperformed traditional radiological assessment, which showed a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 82% in the same cohort.

[4] Longitudinal analysis of the AI-detected cases revealed that the system could identify subtle changes in pancreatic tissue up to 12 months before conventional diagnosis. Among the 45 patients who were AI-positive but initially negative on conventional imaging, 38 (84%) were subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 12 months. The median time to conventional diagnosis was 8.3 months in this group.

[5] The AI system's performance was particularly notable in detecting small lesions (<2 cm) and early-stage tumors. For lesions smaller than 1 cm, the system achieved a detection rate of 85%, compared to 35% for conventional assessment. The false-positive rate was 11%, with most false positives occurring in patients with chronic pancreatitis or other benign pancreatic conditions.

[6] These findings suggest that AI-based imaging analysis could significantly improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved survival rates. The system's ability to detect subtle changes before they become apparent on conventional imaging represents a promising advancement in pancreatic cancer screening. Further validation in larger, multi-center studies is needed to establish the clinical utility of this approach.
